Just a note if you want to use any files in this folder
Most of these are old testing files or have weird uses I don't remember
What I DO remember is that testdata.ipynb is the worst thing I have ever created
there are sections in that code that will crash the server if you run them without commenting out OTHER sections of the code
It was used for simulation and testing, mostly to try to figure out how to minimize error
I gave up after 2 months on it
If you are poking around, have fun, but try not to run it all at once
If you need to use it, Godspeed
