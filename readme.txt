Just a few notes if anyone has to use this in the future:
    A lot of this is old data. Some of it is labeled, some is not. Most of the later "useable" stuff is labeled with the ground test team's established filenameing convention for inertia measurement (as of 4/17/24) so just go based on that.
    Run any code at your own risk. Some of it crashed the server at one point. Anything in the main folder should be fine. Anything in the "here be dragons" folder probably isn't.
    The most important rule of coding is to have fun. Nested for loops are fun.

    If you have any questions about stuff and don't know my contact info already: finnamoreh@gmail.com (205) 213-9008, I'll do my best to help. Good luck!
